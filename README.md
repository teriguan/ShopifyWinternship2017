Teresa's Timepiece Calculator for Shopify Winternship 2017

This is the program I coded for Shopify Wintership 2017.

I modified code from GitHub user siongui titled "[JavaScript] Single Callback For Multiple Asynchronous AJAX Requests (XMLHttpRequest)"
Link: https://siongui.github.io/2012/09/29/javascript-single-callback-for-multiple-asynchronous-xhr-requests/

I borrowed the code for sending multiple AJAX requests and storing the data into one array. The processing of the array is my own work.
